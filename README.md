- Titanic Dataset (Classification)
- California Housing Dataset (Regression)
- Custom Dataset Upload

### Data Exploration
- Data preview and statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Feature visualizations
- Data distribution analysis

### Data Preprocessing
- Missing value handling (Mean imputation, Median imputation, Drop rows)
- Categorical encoding (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding)
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, LDA)

### Model Training
- Multiple algorithms:
  - Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, MLP, Gradient Boosting
  - Regression: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVR, KNN, MLP, Gradient Boosting
